- Docker:
Docker is a platform and tool for developing, deploying, and running applications in containers. Docker is a  tool that helps you create, manage, and run containers, making it easy to deploy and test your code.

- container
A container is an isolated environment for your code
Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that contain everything needed to run an application.
- Docker Image: A Docker image is a static, immutable package of software that includes everything an application needs to run. It's a template or a blueprint for creating containers.
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package of software that includes everything an application needs to run, such as:

1. Code
2. Libraries
3. Dependencies
4. Tools
5. Settings

It's a snapshot of a container that can be run on any system that supports Docker, without requiring a specific environment or configuration.

- BaseImage
A base image is like the foundation or starting point for creating more complex images in Docker. It's a pre-built image that already contains a basic operating system and some essential software components. Developers use base images as a starting point for building their own custom images by adding additional layers of software, configurations, and application code on top.
