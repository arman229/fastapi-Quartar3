# Demystifying Apache Kafka
I'll explain Kafka and these important topics in a way that's easy to understand. Imagine Kafka as a post office for data. Let's break down each part:

### 1. Events
**Events** are like pieces of mail or packages. They are pieces of information that something happened. For example, when you send a text message, that action can be an event.

### 2. Messages
**Messages** are the actual content of the events. They are like the letters inside the envelopes. So, if you think of an event as a letter being sent, the message is what you wrote in the letter.

### 3. Topics
**Topics** are like mailboxes where specific types of messages are collected. Imagine you have different mailboxes for different kinds of letters: one for birthday cards, one for bills, and one for postcards. In Kafka, a topic might collect all events about user logins, another might collect all events about purchases.

### 4. Partitions
**Partitions** are like dividing a big mailbox into several smaller sections. This helps to organize the messages better and makes it faster to find them. For example, if a topic (mailbox) has many messages, partitions can split these messages into smaller parts so they can be read and written faster.

### 5. Brokers
**Brokers** are the post office workers who handle your mail. They store, send, and manage the messages (events). In Kafka, brokers are servers that take care of your data, making sure it goes to the right place and is stored correctly.

### 6. Kafka Producers
**Producers** are like people who send letters. They create messages (events) and send them to the topics (mailboxes). For example, when you send a text message, you are acting like a producer, creating an event and sending it out.

### 7. Kafka Consumers
**Consumers** are like people who receive and read the letters. They read messages from the topics (mailboxes). For example, when you get a text message and read it, you are acting like a consumer, receiving and reading the event.

### Summary
- **Events**: Pieces of information about something that happened.
- **Messages**: The content of the events.
- **Topics**: Mailboxes where messages are collected.
- **Partitions**: Sections of a topic to organize messages better.
- **Brokers**: Servers that manage and store messages.
- **Producers**: Senders of messages.
- **Consumers**: Receivers of messages.

I hope this helps you understand Kafka better! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

# Kafka 3.7 Docker Image
* Get the docker image

      docker pull apache/kafka:3.7.0
* Start the kafka docker container

      docker run -p 9092:9092 apache/kafka:3.7.0
      or
       docker run -p 9092:9092 --name kafkacon apache/kafka:3.7.0
* Open another console and check to see if container running:

      docker ps
* Copy the container name, and give the following command to attach:

      docker exec -it <container-id(first four digits)> /bin/bash
* Note: Kafka commands are in this directory in the container

      cd /opt/kafka/bin
###### CREATE A TOPIC TO STORE YOUR EVENTS      

      /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

###### Describe the Topics

      /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092


######  WRITE SOME EVENTS INTO THE TOPIC

      /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
###### READ THE EVENTS

      /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic quickstart-events --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092


###### Kafka UI
This is a popular open-source web UI specifically designed for viewing Kafka topics, messages, brokers, consumer groups, and even lets you create new topics.       
    
     
       docker network create -d bridge kafka-net

       docker network ls

       docker run -p 9092:9092 --network kafka-net --name kafkacon apache/kafka:3.7.0

       docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --network kafka-net -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_ENABLED=true provectuslabs/kafka-ui
