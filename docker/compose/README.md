Docker Compose is a tool specifically designed to simplify the development and management of applications that consist of multiple Docker containers. 

docker compose up -d: This builds the images (if needed) and starts the container in detached mode (background).  
docker compose stop: This stops the container.
docker compose down: This stops and removes the container.
