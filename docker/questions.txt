When we open a project in a devcontainer, it opens with a prompt like root@55310c740c72:/workspaces/fastapi-Quartar3/docker/Dockerpro# instead of just root@55310c740c72:. Also, when we navigate to root@553310c740c72/code and modify our main.py file, the changes do not reflect in the output. However, if we make changes at the beginning of this file, like in root@55310c740c72:/workspaces/fastapi-Quartar3/docker/Dockerpro#,and modify our main.py file then it works.
