When we define the types then python tell me all the methods and the properties of than object but without defining the types it is not possible.

Literal in pydantic 
In Python's typing module, a literal is a way to specify the specific value or type of a variable, function argument, or return value. Literal types are used to define the exact value that a variable can take.


virtualenv is a tool used to create isolated Python environments. It allows you to create separate environments for different projects, each with its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies are installed globally or for other projects.

Questions: Difference between Concurrency and parallelism in python?
- Concurrency:
Concurrency refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously. 
- Example:
Imagine you are a chef in a busy restaurant kitchen. You have multiple orders coming in at the same time. Instead of waiting for one order to be completed before starting the next, you start working on one order, then switch to another while the first one cooks, and so on. This allows you to make progress on multiple orders concurrently, even though you can only focus on one order at a time.

- Parallelism:
Parallelism, on the other hand, involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple processors or cores. In a parallel system, tasks are truly executed simultaneously, each on its own processor or core.
- Example:
Now, imagine you have a team of chefs working together in the kitchen. Each chef specializes in a different dish. When orders come in, each chef works on their assigned dish simultaneously. For example, one chef is grilling steaks, another is saut√©ing vegetables, and another is preparing salads. By working in parallel, the team can prepare multiple dishes at the same time, which helps to serve customers faster.
