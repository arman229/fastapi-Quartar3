# What is Microservices

A microservice is like breaking down a big task into smaller, manageable jobs. Instead of building a whole car all at once, you focus on building separate parts like the engine, transmission, and wheels. Each part does its own job and talks to other parts through clear instructions.
 
Microservices are great because:

You can work on different parts of your project at the same time without waiting for others.
If one part breaks, it's easier to fix without affecting the rest.
You can reuse the same parts in different projects.
But, it also has challenges:

It can get more complicated to manage many small parts.
You might need extra tools to keep everything running smoothly.
Making sure all the parts communicate well can be tricky.
Overall, microservices help you build software faster, make it more flexible, and handle big projects more easily.

--------------------------OR------------------------------
A microservices application is a software application built using the microservices architecture. This architecture involves breaking down the application into small, independent services that each perform a specific function. These services are:

- Independently deployable: Each service can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently without affecting other parts of the application.
- Loosely coupled: Services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, minimizing dependencies and making them easier to maintain and modify.
- Focused on specific functionality: Each service performs a single, well-defined task, promoting modularity and reusability.
# What is monolithic?
In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. All components of the application, including the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, are tightly integrated into a single codebase and deployed as a single package.

# What are relational and non-relational databases?

- Relational Database:
  A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into one or more tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. The relationships between the tables are established based on common fields (keys). This type of database uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and managing the data.
- Examples of relational databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server, etc.
- Non-Relational Database:
  Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not adhere to the traditional relational database model. They are designed to handle large volumes of data and offer more flexibility in terms of data models. Non-relational databases can be categorized into several types, including document-oriented databases, key-value stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases.
- Examples of non-relational databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB, etc.
